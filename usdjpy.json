  "next_window": "Watch for a break below Pivot S1 at 144.6913, which could accelerate downward momentum.",
  "summary": "Given the close proximity of DXY to its Pivot S1 and a lack of upward momentum, coupled with USD/JPY closing near its daily low, a short position is favored. DXY's stability around 98.75 without clear upward bias supports a cautious approach towards USD strength."
