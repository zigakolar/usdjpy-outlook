  "next_window": "Watch for a potential retest of Pivot R1 at 147.5517, which if broken, could lead to further upside towards 147.7008 in the next 4-8 hours.",
  "summary": "Given the stable DXY close at 97.29 and its proximity to Pivot R1 at 97.33, DXY strength moderately supports a bullish bias for USD/JPY. The absence of high-volatility U.S. events today further supports a stable upward trajectory for the pair."
